cloned this xbmc inhibit shutdown script.
originally it blocks shutdown on active tcp connections.

I've added:
- inhibit shutdown on torrent downloads (Transmission)
- inhibit shutdown if a "lockfile" is present on the system
- add a delay before allowing shutdown again if it was inhibited (this is to make sure we do not shut down directly after dropping a remote connection. If i am logged in remotely, and want to reconnect, i do not want the machine to go down)
- changed the sleep time loop to allow xbmc to shutdown without a long delay
